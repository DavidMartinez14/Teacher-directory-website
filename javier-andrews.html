      <h2>Welcome to Javier Andrews School Website!</h2>

<p>I am Mr.Andrews and welcome to my website for the 2017-2018 school year!  Having grown up in Charleston, South Carolina, I then moved to New Jersey.  After graduating from New Field High School in 2005, I attended Rutgers University, where I received my Bachelor's in History and later my Master's in Teaching Social Studies Secondary Education.  This is my third year at New Field and my fourth year teaching overall.  Before New Field, I taught all New Tech at Lake City High School in the lower part of South Carolina.  This year I am teaching one traditional World Geography class and US History.  Also, I am an assistant varsity football coach here at J.L. Mann.  I am looking forward to this school year and am extremely excited to have each student learn so much about the world.</p>

        <h4>How China Conquered Mongolia</h4>
        <p>he Mongol conquest of China was a series of major military efforts by the Mongol Empire to invade China proper. It spanned six decades in the 13th century and involved the defeat of the Jin dynasty, Western Xia, the Dali Kingdom and the Southern Song. The Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan started the conquest with small-scale raids into Western Xia in 1205 and 1207.By 1279, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan had established the Yuan dynasty in China and crushed the last Song resistance, which marked the onset of all of China under the Mongol Yuan rule. This was the first time in history that the whole of China was conquered and subsequently ruled by a foreign or non-native ruler.</p>
